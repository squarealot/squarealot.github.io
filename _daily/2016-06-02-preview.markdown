yesterday:

* AUD: GDP sell off
* JPY: with inside day break out
* EUR/CHF: trend day up


today; very volatil:

* AUD retail sales (01:30, 03:30)
* ECB rate decision (13:45, 14:30)


expectations:

* AUD/USD: 0.7550 (UP, now: 0.7255)
* USD/JPY: 108.40 (DOWN, now: 109.50)
* USD/CHF: 0.9930 **(UP: 0.9880) ????? SL run?**
* there is plenty of room

SL run; reversal whole Wed. day range; More buying on prev-day-lows. Not shure about 01:30/03:30 but expecting SL run before/into 13:45/14:30 and fast bid afterwards.
